The JavaScript code in the Static folder generates a dashboard of data from the following dataset: 
<blockquote>Hulcr, J. et al. (2012) A Jungle in There: Bacteria in Belly Buttons are Highly Diverse, but Predictable. Retrieved from: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/results-and-data/</blockquote>

The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The microbial species are also known as operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study. 

Pulling the data from a <a href=https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json>json</a>, the website dashboard allows users to look at individuals who were tested. The dashboard includes information about the individual, a bar chart of the top 10 OTUs found in the individual, and a bubble chart of all OTUs found and their frequency. The plots are generated in Plotly.

The website to view the data can be found <a href=https://hfattor.github.io/belly-button-challenge/>here.</a>
